Versioning
----------------
For transparency in a release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, a project should be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we should adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and constructed with the following guidelines:
- Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps only the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.

Build
----------------
Clone the project and come in:

``` bash
